# Text_Classification_with_GAN
Implementing a Gated Attention Network (GAN) for text classification using PyTorch and comparing it with BiLSTM and soft attention models on the IMDb and TREC dataset

## Prerequisites:
Before you start, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

PyTorch
Torchtext (for dataset handling)
NumPy
Scikit-learn (for evaluation)
IMDb dataset: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz
TREC dataset: https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/Data/QA/QC/
